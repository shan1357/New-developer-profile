            <h3>JavaScript & PHP developer</h3>
            <p>A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of
                World
                Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript
                in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications
                between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end
                developer),
                server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer). A web content management
                system may be used to develop and maintain web applications.</p>

            <h2>Becom A Web Developer</h2>

            <p>Is being a web developer a good career decision? Well, it depends on what you’re looking for in a career.

                There are some qualities of web development careers, such as job availability and base salary, that make
                this option a great fit for anyone who wants a secure and high paying job. While good pay and
                flexibility are historically among some of the biggest contributors to job satisfaction, they aren’t the
                only ones.

                Getting appreciated for your work, finding opportunities to learn and grow, and an interest in the job
                itself are also high-ranking aspects of job satisfaction. Luckily, those also happen to be some of the
                primary benefits of web development as a career. Here are five reasons to go into web development that
                might convince you to get started today.</p>

                <p>What is a pro developer?
                    My personal definition of a professional developer is a developer who is able to build and maintain
                    a
                    commercial piece of software. In other words, if said developer made or edited software, and that
                    software is generating money for someone somewhere even indirectly, then the developer who made it
                    is
                    professional.</p>

                <p>What do entry level developers do?
                    An entry-level software developer has simpler duties compared to more senior members of the field.
                    At
                    the entry level, your responsibilities are to create simple, single-thread code to achieve a
                    specific
                    task. ... You may also have to create or write a design algorithm by which you create software.</p>
